# PassFraise

PassFraise is a local password manager app written in Python. This application allows users to securely store and manage their passwords locally on their device. After several months on hiatus from this project, I am relearning how it works. I am aware that the current state of this project is very poor, and I am planning to actively work on improving it.

## Project Goals
*This project is not meant to be the most secure, or by any other metric, the best password manager. My primary goal is learning and improving my own skills.*

## Features
- Securely store and manage passwords locally
- Encrypt passwords using Fernet encryption
- User authentication with hashed passwords

## Future Improvements (Distant Future. Like Extremely Distant.)
- **Cloud Sync**: Add an option to sync passwords with a secure cloud service.
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enhance security by adding two-factor authentication for accessing the password manager.
